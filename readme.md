## Some thoughts...

> For some time I have been asking myself the question "What if programming was fun again?". <br/>
> Tano is more or less my answer to that question.

> Originally my goal was to develop a new programming language,
> which did not have the goal of gaining many followers,
> but should only bring me personal fun in programming again,
> by combining all kinds of features and concepts from languages I have taught over the years.
> However, such a language is not easy to develop and requires time, time that I don't have,
> because, like most people, I have a job and have to maintain personal relationships...<br/><br/>
> This is where Tano comes into play. For my work, I needed a framework for developing PWAs,
> I had some prototypes that were made for fun and for testing on my computer and
> So I decided to make something useful for me from these prototypes.<br/>
> The original versions were implemented in Vanilla JS and came from the need to simply develop dynamic SPAs without
> having to install NPM and co.<br/>
> At the same time, I have done a lot of work with Deno for smaller tools and so it happened that I developed Tano for
> Deno...
